# College Admissions and Debt Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This project explores a dataset of U.S. colleges to analyze trends in **admission rates** and **median student debt**. The analysis was performed in R and includes summary statistics, visualizations, and inferential statistics to uncover insights about college accessibility and financial burden across regions. 

## ðŸ§  Tasks Completed

### âœ… Task 1: Load Workspace
Loaded the `.RData` file containing the dataset required for analysis.

### âœ… Task 2: Summary Stats â€“ Admission Rate
- Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation, IQR
- Compared mean vs. median and SD vs. IQR for skewness and spread

### âœ… Task 3: Summary Stats â€“ Median Debt
- Similar analysis as Task 2, focused on financial metrics

### âœ… Task 4: Histogram â€“ Admission Rate
- Custom bins, blue color scheme
- Interpreted shape: skewed and unimodal

### âœ… Task 5: Boxplot â€“ Admission Rate
- Identified potential outliers

### âœ… Task 6: Shapiro-Wilk Test â€“ Admission Rate
- Tested for normality
- p-value indicated non-normal distribution

### âœ… Task 7â€“8: Histogram & Boxplot â€“ Median Debt
- Found the distribution to be roughly symmetric and unimodal

### âœ… Task 9: Shapiro-Wilk Test â€“ Median Debt
- p-value supported normality assumption

### âœ… Task 10: CI for Median Debt Difference (Plains vs Lakes)
- Used two-sample t-test with equal variances
- Interpreted confidence interval and p-value

### âœ… Task 11: CI for Proportion of Colleges in Higher SAT Category
- Used normal approximation to construct 99.8% CI

### âœ… Task 12: CI for Variance of Median Debt
- Used chi-square distribution
- Verified normality assumption from earlier tasks

### âœ… Task 13: One-Sample Hypothesis Test â€“ Admission Rate
- Tested whether mean < 0.675 using t-distribution
- Compared results from p-value and critical value methods

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- R
- RStudio
- Libraries: `EnvStats`, `stats`

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `FinalRProject.R`
- `.RData`

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All assumptions for statistical tests were verified through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Shapiro-Wilk tests.
- This project demonstrates the full data analysis pipeline: summary statistics â†’ data visualization â†’ inferential statistics.
